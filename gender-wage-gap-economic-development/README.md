# Gender Wage Gap and Economic Development in Latin America

This project analyzes the relationship between gender wage gaps and economic development in Latin America using panel data from 2000 to 2022.

The empirical strategy relies on standard panel data econometric methods, including:
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Fixed Effects (Within estimator)
- Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE)

The analysis uses data from GenLAC and the World Bank to examine how GDP per capita and female labor force participation are associated with variations in gender wage gaps across countries and over time.

## Methods
- Panel data econometrics
- OLS, Fixed Effects, TWFE
- Country and time fixed effects

## Data
- GenLAC
- World Bank (GDP per capita, constant USD)

## Tools
