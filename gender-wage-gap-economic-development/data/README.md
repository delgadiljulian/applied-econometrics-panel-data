## Data sources

This project uses publicly available data from:

- World Bank World Development Indicators (GDP per capita, constant USD)
- GenLAC database (gender wage gap and labor force participation)

Raw data files and intermediate datasets (e.g. `.dta`, `.xlsx`) are not included in this repository due to licensing and size considerations.

All datasets used in the analysis can be reproduced by running the Stata do-files in the `code/` directory.
